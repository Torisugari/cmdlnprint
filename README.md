#cmdlnprint#

Addon for Firefox and Iceweasel to print a webpage using command line.

##Why this plugin exists?##
Sometimes you need to automate the process of print a webpage to a local printer or create a PDF from a web application that doesn't create it. This is when cmdlnprint comes useful.

A good example is to create PDF files from a web application. Sometimes the application cannot create the PDF. sometimes you don't have time to programming the report.

This is printing using the print command dialog. And it's different than other approachs. By example there are projects based on PHP or Webkit+QT that create a PDF from a HTML file, but they doesn't implement HTML4 in the right way (correct use of THEAD and TFOOT, by example). And Firefox works in this escenarios like a charm.
